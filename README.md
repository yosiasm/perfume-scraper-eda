I run this in python 3.9.4
I save visualization on assets folder

1. install requirements.txt
2. create folder noses, perfumes
3. Scrap list perfumes: scrap.ipynb (chaotic)
4. Scrap perfumes detail: scrap.py
5. Preprocess + visualize data: preproces.ipynb

note: I don't upload data in this repo

Challenge:
1. The website is cloudflare protected
2. Number of request is limited (3 page/minutes)
